# Twitter Compose

Hi good folks at Sprout,

I've included all dependencies and already built and bundled everything  and altered the initial server to also serve page. 

So, all you have to do is open your terminal and run `npm run start`  and navigate to `http://localhost:3001/`. 

Have fun,

Zan
